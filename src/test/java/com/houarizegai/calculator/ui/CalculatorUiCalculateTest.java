Scenario 1: Testing addition operation
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateWithAdditionOperation
  Description: This test is designed to check the addition operation of the calculate method. We will provide two numbers along with the '+' operator and expect the method to return the correct sum.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will provide two numbers, say 7.5 and 2.5, and the '+' operator as input.
  Act: Invoke the calculate method with the above parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 10.0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the calculate method correctly performs the addition operation. This is important as it directly affects the functionality of the calculator.
Scenario 2: Testing subtraction operation
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateWithSubtractionOperation
  Description: This test is designed to check the subtraction operation of the calculate method. We will provide two numbers along with the '-' operator and expect the method to return the correct result of the subtraction operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will provide two numbers, say 7.5 and 2.5, and the '-' operator as input.
  Act: Invoke the calculate method with the above parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 5.0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the calculate method correctly performs the subtraction operation. This is crucial for the calculator to function correctly.
Scenario 3: Testing division operation with second number as zero
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateWithDivisionByZero
  Description: The test is meant to check the division operation of the calculate method when the second number is zero. We expect the method to return infinity as per the Java specification.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will provide two numbers, say 7.5 and 0, and the '/' operator as input.
  Act: Invoke the calculate method with the above parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the calculate method correctly handles division by zero, returning infinity as per the Java specification. This is important to ensure the calculator behaves as expected in such scenarios.
Scenario 4: Testing unrecognized operation
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateWithUnrecognizedOperation
  Description: The test is designed to check the behavior of the calculate method when provided with an unrecognized operation. We expect the method to return the second number by default.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will provide two numbers, say 7.5 and 2.5, and the 'x' operator as input.
  Act: Invoke the calculate method with the above parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 2.5.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the calculate method correctly handles unrecognized operations, returning the second number as per the method's implementation. This is important to ensure the calculator behaves as expected in such scenarios.
