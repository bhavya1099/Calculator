================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: In the method 'calculate', division or modulus by zero is not checked, which can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior of the program.
Solution: Ensure to check if the denominator is zero before using division or modulus operator. Programmatically, handle this situation either by returning an error message or handling it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Math.pow() function is used without considering the potential of overflows and underflows, which could lead to incorrect calculation results and might be exploited.
Solution: Before using Math.pow(), consider checking if the result will overflow or underflow the datatype bounds. If yes, handle the situation programmatically by either limiting the values or switching to datatypes with a larger range.

Vulnerability: CWE-840: Business Logic Errors
Issue: Providing the capability to perform operations not defined in the basic operations like '+','-','*','/','%','^' could lead to inadvertent behavior or misuse.
Solution: Ensure programmatic controls are in place to limit operations to only the allowed operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Import statements like 'import static' imply unused or potential debugging code left in the program which might expose internal functionalities.
Solution: Remove any leftover or unused code or import statements from the final version of the software and add a policy to prevent inclusion of debug code in production software.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test addition operator
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateForAddition
  Description: This test verifies whether the addition operation is functioning correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers and the '+' operator.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method.
    Assert: The sum of two numbers from the method should match the expected value.
  Validation:
    Confirm that the calculate method returns correct addition results. If the test passes, it means the calculator's addition functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test subtraction operator
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateForSubtraction
  Description: To check whether subtraction operation is returning the correct values
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two numbers and a subtraction operator.
    Act: Call the calculate method.
    Assert: Compare the output of the method with expected result.
  Validation:
    Verifies that our subtraction operation is working correctly within the application.

Scenario 3: Test multiplication operator
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateForMultiplication
  Description: This test ensures the correct result is returned for multiplication operator.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare two numbers and multiplication operator.
    Act: Invoke calculate method with set parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned result equals the expected multiplication of the numbers.
  Validation:
    Validates that the calculator provides accurate multiplication results.

Scenario 4: Test division operator
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateForDivision
  Description: To validate that the division operation is functioning as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Input two numbers and a division operator.
    Act: Call the calculate method with prepared parameters.
    Assert: Assure that the returned result equals the expected quotient of the numbers.
  Validation:
    The function of the division operator is validated and assured that it is returning precise division results.

Scenario 5: Test modulo operator
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateForModulo
  Description: Evaluates the calculator's capability to accurately compute the modulus operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assemble two numbers and a '%' operator.
    Act: Invoke calculate method with prepared parameters.
    Assert: Assert that the returned output equals the expected result of the modulus operation.
  Validation:
    Assures that the modulus operator functions accurately to yield the remainder of the division operation.

 Scenario 6: Testing power operator
 Details:
   TestName: testCalculateForPower
   Description: Ensures that the calculator is correctly computing the power operation.
   Execution:
     Arrange: Ring together two numbers and '^' operator.
     Act: Invoke the calculate method with prepared variables.
     Assert: Assert that the returned output equals the expected result of the power operation.
   Validation:
     Validates the correct functionality of the power operator to yield the correct value when one number is raised to the power of the second number.

 Scenario 7: Testing invalid operator
 Details:
   TestName: testCalculateForInvalidOperator
   Description: This test ensures that the method returns secondNumber for any unsupported operator.
   Execution:
     Arrange: Establish two numbers and an unsupported operator.
     Act: Invoke the calculate method with prepared parameters.
     Assert: The returned output should match the secondNumber.
   Validation:
     The test validates the scenario given an invalid operator ensuring that the method behaves as expected.

Scenario 8: Test division by zero
Details:
  TestName: testCalculateForDividingByZero
  Description: Tests the division by zero operation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide two numbers where second number is zero and a division operator.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with these parameters.
    Assert: The method should return infinity, as division by zero in Java results in infinity.
  Validation:
    Ensures that the method handles division by zero correctly, without throwing Exceptions like ArithmeticException.
