Scenario 1: Testing Addition Operation
Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOperation
  Description: This test is designed to check the addition operation of the calculate method. We will provide two numbers along with the '+' operator and expect the sum of the two numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers, say 5.0 and 3.0, and operator '+'.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the two numbers and '+'.
    Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 8.0.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the calculate method correctly adds two numbers. The expected result is based on the standard math operation of addition.
Scenario 2: Testing Division Operation
Details:
  TestName: testDivisionOperation
  Description: This test is designed to check the division operation of the calculate method. We will provide two numbers along with the '/' operator and expect the quotient of the two numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers, say 10.0 and 2.0, and operator '/'.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the two numbers and '/'.
    Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 5.0.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the calculate method correctly divides two numbers. The expected result is based on the standard math operation of division.
Scenario 3: Testing Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: testDivisionByZero
  Description: This test is designed to check the error handling of the calculate method when dividing by zero. We will provide a number and zero along with the '/' operator and expect an arithmetic exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a number, say 10.0, and zero, and operator '/'.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the number and zero and '/'.
    Assert: Expect an ArithmeticException.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the calculate method correctly handles division by zero by throwing an ArithmeticException. This is expected as division by zero is undefined in mathematics.
Scenario 4: Testing Invalid Operator
Details:
  TestName: testInvalidOperator
  Description: This test is designed to check the calculate method's behavior when an invalid operator is provided. We will provide two numbers along with an invalid operator and expect the method to return the second number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers, say 10.0 and 2.0, and an invalid operator, say 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the two numbers and 'a'.
    Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 2.0.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the calculate method correctly handles an invalid operator by returning the second number. This is the default behavior of the method when an invalid operator is encountered.
