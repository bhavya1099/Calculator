================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-369: Division by Zero
Issue: In the 'calculate' function, there is a division operation without checking if the denominator (secondNumber) is zero. This can lead to a runtime ArithmeticException, potentially crashing the application.
Solution: Before performing division, check if the denominator is zero. If it is, handle it appropriately, such as returning an error message or a specific value.

Vulnerability: CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
Issue: The 'calculate' function defaults to returning the 'secondNumber' if the operator is not recognized. This can lead to inaccurate calculations if an unexpected operator is passed.
Solution: Instead of defaulting to 'secondNumber', throw an exception or return an error value when the operator is not recognized.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Addition Operation
Details:  
  TestName: testAddition
  Description: This test is meant to check the addition functionality in the calculate method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers and the '+' operator as the input parameters.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the arranged parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly adds the two numbers. The expected result is the sum of the two numbers. This test is significant to ensure the calculator performs addition correctly.

Scenario 2: Test Subtraction Operation
Details:  
  TestName: testSubtraction
  Description: This test is meant to check the subtraction functionality in the calculate method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers and the '-' operator as the input parameters.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the arranged parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly subtracts the second number from the first. The expected result is the difference of the two numbers. This test is significant to ensure the calculator performs subtraction correctly.

Scenario 3: Test Division Operation
Details:  
  TestName: testDivision
  Description: This test is meant to check the division functionality in the calculate method. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers and the '/' operator as the input parameters.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the arranged parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly divides the first number by the second. The expected result is the quotient of the two numbers. This test is significant to ensure the calculator performs division correctly.

Scenario 4: Test Division by Zero
Details:  
  TestName: testDivisionByZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the error handling when the second number in the division operation is zero. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a number and zero and the '/' operator as the input parameters.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the arranged parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an ArithmeticException.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles division by zero. The expected result is an ArithmeticException. This test is significant to ensure the calculator handles errors correctly.

Scenario 5: Test Invalid Operator
Details:  
  TestName: testInvalidOperator
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the calculate method when an invalid operator is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two numbers and an invalid operator as the input parameters.
    Act: Invoke the calculate method with the arranged parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected result.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles invalid operators. The expected result is the second number. This test is significant to ensure the calculator handles invalid operators correctly.
