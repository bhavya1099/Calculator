"""
Scenario 1: Simple Addition
Details:
TestName: testSimpleAddition.
Description: This test is meant to ensure that the calculate method accurately calculates the sum of two numbers when the '+' operator is used.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize firstNumber as 5.0, secondNumber as 3.0, and operator as '+'.
Act: Invoke calculate method with firstNumber, secondNumber and operator.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 8.0.
Validation:
This assertion validates that the calculate function correctly returns the addition of two numbers when the '+' operator is selected. If it successfully does, it means the calculate method can handle addition operations correctly.
Scenario 2: Division by Zero
Details:
TestName: testDivisionByZero.
Description: This test is to check if the calculate method handles the exception of division by zero when the '/' operator is used.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize firstNumber as 10.0, secondNumber as 0.0, and operator as '/'.
Act: Invoke calculate method with firstNumber, secondNumber and operator.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is Infinity.
Validation:
The assertion ensures that when the second number is zero, and the '/' operator is used, the function returns Infinity as per Java's handling of division by zero. If it successfully does, it means that the calculate method can handle the division by zero scenario correctly.
Scenario 3: Power of Negative Numbers
Details:
TestName: testPowerOfNegativeNumbers.
Description: This test is meant to ensure that the calculate method accurately calculates the power of a negative number raised to another number when the '^' operator is used.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize firstNumber as -3.0, secondNumber as 2.0, and operator as '^'.
Act: Invoke calculate method with firstNumber, secondNumber and operator.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 9.0.
Validation:
The assertion validates that the calculate function can correctly return the result of a negative number raised to a power. If it successfully does, it means that the calculate method can handle power operations with negative numbers correctly.
Scenario 4: Default Operator
Details:
TestName: testDefaultOperator.
Description: This test examines the calculate method's handling of an unrecognized operator, expecting it to return the second number.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize firstNumber as 10.0, secondNumber as 5.0, and operator as an invalid operator like '&'.
Act: Invoke calculate method with firstNumber, secondNumber, and operator.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 5.0.
Validation:
This assertion confirms that the calculate function correctly handles an unrecognized operator by returning the second number. If it does, it means the calculate method's default case is correctly implemented.
