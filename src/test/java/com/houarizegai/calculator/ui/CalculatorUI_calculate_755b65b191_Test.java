Here are some test scenarios for the function calculate:

1. Test Scenario: Addition of two positive numbers
   - Input: firstNumber = 4, secondNumber = 5, operator = '+'
   - Expected Output: 9.0

2. Test Scenario: Subtraction of two positive numbers where the first number is greater than the second
   - Input: firstNumber = 10, secondNumber = 5, operator = '-'
   - Expected Output: 5.0

3. Test Scenario: Subtraction of two positive numbers where the second number is greater than the first
   - Input: firstNumber = 2, secondNumber = 5, operator = '-'
   - Expected Output: -3.0

4. Test Scenario: Multiplication of two positive numbers
   - Input: firstNumber = 3, secondNumber = 5, operator = '*'
   - Expected Output: 15.0

5. Test Scenario: Division of two positive numbers where the first number is greater than the second
   - Input: firstNumber = 10, secondNumber = 5, operator = '/'
   - Expected Output: 2.0

6. Test Scenario: Division of two positive numbers where the second number is greater than the first
   - Input: firstNumber = 5, secondNumber = 10, operator = '/'
   - Expected Output: 0.5

7. Test Scenario: Division by zero
   - Input: firstNumber = 5, secondNumber = 0, operator = '/'
   - Expected Output: Infinity (or throw an exception based on your design)

8. Test Scenario: Modulo operation of two positive numbers where the first number is greater than the second
   - Input: firstNumber = 10, secondNumber = 3, operator = '%'
   - Expected Output: 1.0

9. Test Scenario: Power operation where the base and exponent are positive numbers
   - Input: firstNumber = 2, secondNumber = 3, operator = '^'
   - Expected Output: 8.0

10. Test Scenario: Power operation where the base is a positive number and the exponent is zero
    - Input: firstNumber = 2, secondNumber = 0, operator = '^'
    - Expected Output: 1.0

11. Test Scenario: Invalid operator
    - Input: firstNumber = 2, secondNumber = 3, operator = 'a'
    - Expected Output: 3.0 (as per the default case in the switch statement)
