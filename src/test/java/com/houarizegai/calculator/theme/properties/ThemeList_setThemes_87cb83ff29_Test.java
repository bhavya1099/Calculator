Test generated by RoostGPT for test demoTestGitlab using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Scenario: Verify the function when the "themes" list is empty.
   Test Steps: 
   - Create an empty list of Theme.
   - Call the setThemes method with the empty list.
   Expected Result: 
   - The themes variable should be updated with an empty list.

2. Scenario: Verify the function when the "themes" list has one theme.
   Test Steps: 
   - Create a list with one Theme.
   - Call the setThemes method with the list.
   Expected Result: 
   - The themes variable should be updated with the list containing one theme.

3. Scenario: Verify the function when the "themes" list has multiple themes.
   Test Steps: 
   - Create a list with multiple Themes.
   - Call the setThemes method with the list.
   Expected Result: 
   - The themes variable should be updated with the list containing all the themes.

4. Scenario: Verify the function when the "themes" list is null.
   Test Steps: 
   - Call the setThemes method with null.
   Expected Result: 
   - The themes variable should be updated to null or an appropriate exception should be thrown based on the business logic.

5. Scenario: Verify the function when the "themes" list has duplicate themes.
   Test Steps: 
   - Create a list with duplicate Themes.
   - Call the setThemes method with the list.
   Expected Result: 
   - The themes variable should be updated with the list containing duplicate themes.

6. Scenario: Verify the function with a large number of themes in the list.
   Test Steps: 
   - Create a list with a large number of Themes.
   - Call the setThemes method with the list.
   Expected Result: 
   - The themes variable should be updated with the list containing all the themes without any performance issues.

Note: The expected results might vary based on the business logic and the behavior of the list when it is null or has duplicate items.
