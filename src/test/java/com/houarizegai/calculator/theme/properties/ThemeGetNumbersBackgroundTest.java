Scenario 1: Normal usage of getNumbersBackground()

Details:
  TestName: testGetNumbersBackgroundNormalUsage
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the 'getNumbersBackground()' method when it is used as intended.
Execution:
  Arrange: Here, we presume 'numbersBackground' is already initialized with a valid value.
  Act: The 'getNumbersBackground()' method is invoked, no parameters are required.
  Assert: The assertion is that the return value of the method corresponds with the value 'numbersBackground' was initialized with.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that 'getNumbersBackground()' correctly retrieves the 'numbersBackground' value.
  If 'getNumbersBackground()' can't correctly retrieve a value it's supposed to get, this signifies a core issue in getting the property of an object.

Scenario 2: AssertNotNull check of getNumbersBackground()

Details:
  TestName: testGetNumbersBackgroundNotNull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getNumbersBackground()' method returns a non-null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Again, we presume 'numbersBackground' is initialized before the call to 'getNumbersBackground()'
  Act: The 'getNumbersBackground()' method is invoked.
  Assert: The assertion is that the returned value of the 'getNumbersBackground()' method is not null.
Validation:
  This test checks that 'getNumbersBackground()' never returns null by design. If this method returns null, it is likely there's a mistake in initializing 'numbersBackground' or in 'getNumbersBackground()', which would indicate a serious flaw in our java code.

Scenario 3: NumbersBackground is not yet initialized 

Details:
  TestName: testGetNumbersBackgroundNotInitialized
  Description: This test is meant to check that 'getNumbersBackground()' returns null or the default value for uninitialized class members of the corresponding type when 'numbersBackground' has not been initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setting up necessary in this test, as we are assuming 'numbersBackground' isn't initialized.
  Act: Invoke the 'getNumbersBackground()' method.
  Assert: The assertion must be that the 'getNumbersBackground()' method returns null or the default value for uninitialized class members.
Validation:
  This test validates the Java language specification, which states that class variables are given a default value if they are not explicitly initialized. If this concept is not understood by the Java programmer, s/he could run into problems where they're expecting an error but instead receive the default value.
