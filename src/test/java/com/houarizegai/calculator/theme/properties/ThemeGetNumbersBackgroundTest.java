================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Encapsulation Principle Breaking (CWE-488)
Issue: The function getNumbersBackground() directly exposes a panel property. This may lead to unintended access or manipulation of the existing data by other components in your program. This might potentially lead to confidentiality and integrity violation.
Solution: Consider making the numbersBackground variable private and providing a getter method for access. You should avoid returning references to mutable objects directly. You can return a new object or an unmodifiable view.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: Without validation checks, callers may pass in unexpected, possibly malicious data, impacting the functionality of your program or posing security risks.
Solution: Consider adding relevant validation checks before processing the input. Regular expressions can be a useful tool for this.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Positive Test for getNumbersBackground() method

Details:
  TestName: testGetNumbersBackground
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getNumbersBackground() method, including its ability to return the correct value of the numbersBackground.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as this is a simple getter method.
  Act: Invoke the getNumbersBackground() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the expected value of numbersBackground.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that getNumbersBackground() method is correctly returning the value of the numbersBackground member variable. The expected result is the value that this variable was last set to. This test is essential to validate that the system correctly retrieves this setting, which could be used in other aspects of the application's functionality.

Scenario 2: Verify the returned value when numbersBackground is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetNumbersBackgroundWhenNotSet
  Description: This test checks the getNumbersBackground() method when the numbersBackground has not been set in the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure numbersBackground is not set or null.
  Act: Invoke the getNumbersBackground() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that when numbersBackground is not set, getNumbersBackground() method returns null. This test is important since it checks the default behavior of the method when the numbersBackground variable has not been set.

Scenario 3: Test with Mock Object

Details:
  TestName: testGetNumbersBackgroundWithMockObject
  Description: This test checks the getNumbersBackground() method with a mock object. It is to ensure the method can get the value from a mock object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock object with a predefined value of numbersBackground.
  Act: Invoke the getNumbersBackground() method on the mock object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value matches the predefined mock value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that even with a mock object, getNumbersBackground() is able to return the correct value, reinforcing the robustness and versatility of the method.
