Test Scenario 1: Test getThemesAsMap() with an empty list of themes
We should test the scenario where the themes list is empty. The expected result would be an empty map.

Test Scenario 2: Test getThemesAsMap() with a list of themes with unique names
In this scenario, we should test the function with a list of themes where each theme has a unique name. The expected result would be a map where each entry corresponds to a theme, and the key is the theme name.

Test Scenario 3: Test getThemesAsMap() with a list of themes with duplicate names
We should test the function with a list of themes where some themes have the same name. As the toMap() method will throw an IllegalStateException when there are duplicate keys, we need to ensure that our function can handle this case properly. 

Test Scenario 4: Test getThemesAsMap() with a list of themes with null names
We should test the function with a list of themes where some themes have a null name. The expected result is a map that contains all themes with non-null names. It should handle themes with null names properly.

Test Scenario 5: Test getThemesAsMap() with a null list of themes
In this scenario, we should test the function with a null list of themes. The expected result is a NullPointerException. The function should handle this exception properly.

Test Scenario 6: Test getThemesAsMap() with a large list of themes
We should test the function with a large list of themes to check its performance. The function should be able to handle a large list of themes without significant performance degradation. 

Test Scenario 7: Test getThemesAsMap() with a list of themes containing special characters in their names
In this scenario, we should test the function with a list of themes where some themes have names containing special characters. The function should handle these themes properly, and the resulting map should contain these themes with their names as keys.
