================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials
Issue: This class method, getApplicationBackground(), allows for the transmission of sensitive information without incorporating any form of protection mechanisms. As such, the data can be intercepted and misused in potential information disclosure attacks.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive information using secure protocols such as SSL or TLS when transmitting over an insecure network. Consider incorporating in-built Java cryptographic libraries.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The code does not implement any access control mechanisms to restrict access to the getApplicationBackground() method, thereby potentially exposing sensitive application background data to unauthorized entities. This could lead to possible misuse of information and modification of user settings.
Solution: Institute proper access control mechanisms and principles of least privilege for the getApplicationBackground() method. Use encapsulation to restrict access to this method from unauthorized entities.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In case of errors or exceptions, sensitive information may be revealed under improper exception handling. Attacker could use this information to understand the inner workings of the application and exploit the system.
Solution: Implement a global exception handler that catches all unhandled and unexpected exceptions. Ensure that exception handling does not return detailed error messages or any sensitive system information.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when applicationBackground returns valid data

Details:
  TestName: testValidApplicationBackground
  Description: This test is meant to verify the GetApplicationBackground function returns the valid application background data. The function is supposed to return the stored value for applicationBackground.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as it is a simple getter without parameter implementation.
    Act: Call getApplicationBackground() method.
    Assert: Confirm returned value matches the expected value for applicationBackground stored.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that getApplicationBackground operation is performing correctly and returning the accurate value for applicationBackground. The test is critical to ensure that the data from applicationBackground is being retrieved successfully without any alteration.


Scenario 2: Test when applicationBackground is null

Details:
  TestName: testNullApplicationBackground
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the GetApplicationBackground function correctly handles the case where the applicationBackground is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set applicationBackground to null embedded in the system by some way.
    Act: Call getApplicationBackground() method.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The aim of this test is to validate that when the applicationBackground is null, the getApplicationBackground method correctly handles this and returns null. The test is critical to ensure the robustness of the application and its ability to handle corner cases without throwing exceptions or causing unexpected behavior.
