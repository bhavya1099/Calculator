Scenario 1: Verify that getThemes returns an empty list if no themes are set

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesReturnsEmptyList
  Description: This test checks if the getThemes method returns an empty list when no themes have been added to the ThemeList.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList instance and ensure no themes are set.
  Act: Call the getThemes method on the ThemeList instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  Clarification: The test asserts that the size of the returned list is 0.
  Significance: This test ensures that the getThemes method correctly handles situations where no themes have been initialized, which is crucial for maintaining correct behavior in scenarios where the theme setup is optional or incremental.

Scenario 2: Verify that getThemes returns the correct list of themes after setting them

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesReturnsCorrectThemes
  Description: This test checks if the getThemes method accurately returns a list of themes after they have been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList instance and set a predefined list of themes using the setThemes method.
  Act: Retrieve the themes using getThemes.
  Assert: Assert that the returned themes match the initial list set in the ThemeList.
Validation:
  Clarification: The test asserts that the list returned by getThemes is equal to the list set by setThemes.
  Significance: This test verifies that getThemes properly reflects changes after themes have been set, which is fundamental for accurately displaying or using the themes in the application.

Scenario 3: Verify the immutability of the list returned by getThemes

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesListImmutability
  Description: This test checks if the list returned by the getThemes method is immutable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList instance and set a list of themes.
  Act: Attempt to modify the list returned by the getThemes method by adding a new theme to it.
  Assert: Catch UnsupportedOperationException to ensure immutability.
Validation:
  Clarification: The test checks that modifying the returned list directly throws an UnsupportedOperationException.
  Significance: Ensuring the returned list is immutable prevents accidental modifications that could lead to inconsistent states within the application, enhancing the robustness of coding using the ThemeList.

Scenario 4: Verify that subsequent modifications to the theme list do not affect the result of getThemes

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesIndependenceFromInternalState
  Description: This test ensures that any changes made to the internal list of the ThemeList after calling getThemes do not affect the originally retrieved list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList, set initial themes, and retrieve them using getThemes.
  Act: Add more themes to the ThemeList after retrieving the list.
  Assert: Assert that the originally retrieved themes list does not reflect the newly added themes.
Validation:
  Clarification: This test asserts that the list retrieved from getThemes does not change even if the internal state of ThemeList changes.
  Significance: This test ensures the integrity and snapshot nature of the themes list at the time of calling getThemes, which is vital for preventing unexpected behavior in concurrent or multi-step scenarios.

/*
The test failure in `testGetThemesReturnsEmptyList` is due to a `NullPointerException` occurring when the `isEmpty()` method is invoked. This exception is specifically stemming from the attempt to call `isEmpty()` on what turns out to be a `null` object returned by `getThemes()`.

In the business logic, the `getThemes()` method returns the `themes` field. Given that the `themes` field has a default value of `null` and is private (without any method visibly populating it in the given context), whenever `getThemes()` is called before `themes` is initialized with an actual list (like an `ArrayList`), it will return `null`. Consequently, attempting to execute any methods on this `null` reference, such as `isEmpty()`, leads to a `NullPointerException`.

For the test to pass or to be valid, you need to ensure that the `themes` field is initialized before methods are invoked on it. If the test is meant to verify that `getThemes()` can handle cases where `themes` is null (i.e., returning an empty list or some null-safe operation), the method implementation should be adjusted to handle this scenario appropriately, perhaps by initializing `themes` beforehand or by modifying `getThemes()` to return an empty list instead of `null`. Alternatively, the logic in the `testGetThemesReturnsEmptyList` should handle or expect a `null` return value without calling `isEmpty()` directly on it.

The test failure in the `testGetThemesListImmutability()` method is due to the expectation that modifying the list returned by `getThemes()` should throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`. The error log clearly indicates that this exception was expected but was not thrown when trying to modify the fetched list of themes.

In Java, the `UnsupportedOperationException` is typically thrown to indicate that the requested operation is not supported. This is common with immutable collections, where operations that modify the collection (like `add` or `remove`) are not allowed.

The test case appears to be designed with the intention of ensuring that the list of themes returned by `getThemes()` is immutable, meaning it cannot be altered after its creation. However, the method `getThemes()` as described seems to simply return the underlying list `themes`. In Java, returning a direct reference to a mutable collection like `ArrayList` won't make it immutable. As such, the `UnsupportedOperationException` was not thrown because the list remains mutable, allowing additions and other modifications without error.

To achieve the desired immutability (assuming that is the intended design), the method `getThemes()` needs to return an immutable view of the list. This can typically be done using `Collections.unmodifiableList(themes)` instead of simply returning `themes`. Adjusting the `getThemes()` method to wrap the returned list with `Collections.unmodifiableList` would make the underlying list unmodifiable and would throw the `UnsupportedOperationException` when attempting modifications, thereby passing the failing test.

However, the provided test and error log strongly indicate that the necessary immutability hasn't been implemented, resulting in the failure as no exception was thrown when the test tried to modify the returned list.

public void testGetThemesListImmutability() {
    List<Theme> themes = new ArrayList<>();
    Theme theme = new Theme();

    themeList.setThemes(themes);
    List<Theme> fetchedThemes = themeList.getThemes();
    assertThrows(UnsupportedOperationException.class, () -> fetchedThemes.add(new Theme()));
}

/*
The test `testGetThemesIndependenceFromInternalState` is failing due to an issue with the list reference being returned directly from the `getThemes` method. This means when you fetch the themes initially and assign them to `fetchedThemes`, you are not retrieving a new list but just a reference to the original `themes` list from your `themeList` instance.

In the test, after fetching the themes, you directly manipulate the returned list by adding a new theme (`newTheme`). Since `getThemes()` returns a direct reference to its `themes` field, any additions to `fetchedThemes` will reflect on the actual `themeList.themes` because they are pointing to the same list in memory. Hence, when you later check the size of `fetchedThemes`, it results in 2 instead of the expected 1, because the list has been modified directly.

To pass this test, `getThemes()` method should return a new list or a copy of the list, thus decoupling the original list from the returned list and making it immune to external modifications. Unfortunately, based on the extract shared, `getThemes()` is returning the direct reference, causing the test to fail when checking the size of the list after an external modification.

@Tag("valid")
public void testGetThemesIndependenceFromInternalState() {
    List<Theme> initialThemes = new ArrayList<>();
    Theme theme = new Theme();
    theme.setName("Classic");
    initialThemes.add(theme);
    themeList.setThemes(initialThemes);
    List<Theme> fetchedThemes = themeList.getThemes();
    // Modify the theme list after fetching
    Theme newTheme = new Theme();
    newTheme.setName("Modern");
    themeList.getThemes().add(newTheme);
    // Should not reflect new changes
    assertEquals(1, fetchedThemes.size());
