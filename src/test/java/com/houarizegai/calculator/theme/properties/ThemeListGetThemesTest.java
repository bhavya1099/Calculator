Scenario 1: Test for the return of an empty theme list

Details:  
  TestName: testGetThemesWhenEmpty.
  Description: This test will test if the getThemes() method returns an empty list when no themes have been set beforehand. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty theme list.
  Act: Call the getThemes() method.
  Assert: Assert that the getThemes() method returns an empty list.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to check if the getThemes() method correctly handles the scenario when no themes are set. If the getThemes() method correctly returns an empty list, it means it behaves as expected when no themes are set.

Scenario 2: Test for the return of the set theme list

Details:  
  TestName: testGetThemesWhenSet.
  Description: This test will test if the getThemes() method returns the correct theme list which has been set.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Initialize a theme list and set it.
  Act: Call the getThemes() method.
  Assert: Assert that the getThemes() method returns the expected theme list.  
Validation: 
  This test is meant to check if the getThemes() method correctly returns the list of themes that was set. If the getThemes() method correctly returns the set list, it means that it behaves as expected.

Scenario 3: Test for immutability of the returned theme list

Details:  
  TestName: testGetThemesImmutability.
  Description: This test will test if the getThemes() method returns a list that is unmodifiable.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Set a theme list and get the themes.
  Act: Try to add a new theme to the resulted list.
  Assert: Catch the UnsupportedOperationException and thus assert the immutability of the list.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to check if the getThemes() method returns an unmodifiable list as a way to ensure data integrity and avoid unwanted changes to the theme list.

Scenario 4: Test for the null safety of the getThemes method

Details:  
  TestName: testGetThemesNullSafety.
  Description: This test will test if the getThemes() method handles the null value of the themes correctly.
Execution: 
  Arrange: Initialize the themes as null.
  Act: Call the getThemes() method.
  Assert: Assert that the getThemes() method returns null or an empty list (as per the implementation).
Validation:
  This test is meant to check if the getThemes() method handles the null value of themes correctly. If it returns null or an empty list, it would mean that the method has good null safety.
  
Scenario 5: Test the Functionality of getThemes() method with Mock Objects

Details:  
  TestName: testGetThemesWithMock
  Description: This test will check if the getThemes() method works correctly when used with Mock objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object for the theme list and set it to the class.
  Act: Call the getThemes() method.
  Assert: Assert that the getThemes() method returns the mock theme list correctly.
Validation:
  This test is meant to validate the functionality of getThemes() method with mock objects. It's significant because it verifies the methodâ€™s reliability and compatibility with mock testing frameworks.
