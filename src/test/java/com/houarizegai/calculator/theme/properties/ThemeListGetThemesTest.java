"""
Scenario 1: Test when the themes list is null
Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesWhenNull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getThemes method handles null values correctly. The test will be executed with the themes list set to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the themes list to null.
  Act: Invoke the getThemes method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle null values and returns null as expected. This is significant as it checks if the method is robust enough to handle such edge cases.
Scenario 2: Test when the themes list is empty
Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesWhenEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getThemes method handles empty lists correctly. The test will be executed with the themes list set to an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the themes list to an empty list.
  Act: Invoke the getThemes method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method can handle empty lists and returns an empty list as expected. This is significant as it checks if the method is robust enough to handle such edge cases.
Scenario 3: Test when the themes list has elements
Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesWhenNotEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getThemes method retrieves the correct list of themes when the list is not empty. The test will be executed with the themes list set to a list with some elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the themes list to a list with some elements.
  Act: Invoke the getThemes method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is the same as the one set in the arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method retrieves the correct list of themes. This is significant as it checks if the method is working as expected in normal scenarios.
