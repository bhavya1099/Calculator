Scenario 1: Verify that getThemes returns an empty list if no themes are set

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesReturnsEmptyList
  Description: This test checks if the getThemes method returns an empty list when no themes have been added to the ThemeList.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList instance and ensure no themes are set.
  Act: Call the getThemes method on the ThemeList instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  Clarification: The test asserts that the size of the returned list is 0.
  Significance: This test ensures that the getThemes method correctly handles situations where no themes have been initialized, which is crucial for maintaining correct behavior in scenarios where the theme setup is optional or incremental.

Scenario 2: Verify that getThemes returns the correct list of themes after setting them

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesReturnsCorrectThemes
  Description: This test checks if the getThemes method accurately returns a list of themes after they have been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList instance and set a predefined list of themes using the setThemes method.
  Act: Retrieve the themes using getThemes.
  Assert: Assert that the returned themes match the initial list set in the ThemeList.
Validation:
  Clarification: The test asserts that the list returned by getThemes is equal to the list set by setThemes.
  Significance: This test verifies that getThemes properly reflects changes after themes have been set, which is fundamental for accurately displaying or using the themes in the application.

Scenario 3: Verify the immutability of the list returned by getThemes

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesListImmutability
  Description: This test checks if the list returned by the getThemes method is immutable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList instance and set a list of themes.
  Act: Attempt to modify the list returned by the getThemes method by adding a new theme to it.
  Assert: Catch UnsupportedOperationException to ensure immutability.
Validation:
  Clarification: The test checks that modifying the returned list directly throws an UnsupportedOperationException.
  Significance: Ensuring the returned list is immutable prevents accidental modifications that could lead to inconsistent states within the application, enhancing the robustness of coding using the ThemeList.

Scenario 4: Verify that subsequent modifications to the theme list do not affect the result of getThemes

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesIndependenceFromInternalState
  Description: This test ensures that any changes made to the internal list of the ThemeList after calling getThemes do not affect the originally retrieved list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ThemeList, set initial themes, and retrieve them using getThemes.
  Act: Add more themes to the ThemeList after retrieving the list.
  Assert: Assert that the originally retrieved themes list does not reflect the newly added themes.
Validation:
  Clarification: This test asserts that the list retrieved from getThemes does not change even if the internal state of ThemeList changes.
  Significance: This test ensures the integrity and snapshot nature of the themes list at the time of calling getThemes, which is vital for preventing unexpected behavior in concurrent or multi-step scenarios.

/*
The test failure in `testGetThemesReturnsEmptyList` is due to a `NullPointerException` occurring when the `isEmpty()` method is invoked. This exception is specifically stemming from `themes` being `null`. The `getThemes()` business logic method attempts to return the value of `themes`, which is a private field of type `List<Theme>`. The provided business logic does not include any initialization for the `themes` list and it defaults to `null`.

The failing test case is checking whether the returned list from `getThemes()` is empty, which assumes that `themes` is an instantiated, but possibly empty list. However, since `themes` is actually `null` (not initialized as an empty list) when `getThemes()` is called within the test, invoking `isEmpty()` on the result leads to the observed `NullPointerException`.

To resolve this kind of test failure, the implementation of `getThemes()` or the initialization of `themes` should ensure that `themes` is never `null`. Typically, this might involve initializing `themes` as an empty list upon the object's instantiation, or modifying the `getThemes()` method to return an empty list if `themes` is `null`.

The test assumes that `getThemes()` should not return `null` but an empty list if no themes have been set. Adjusting the implementation to meet this expectation will resolve the test error.

/*
The test failure in the `testGetThemesListImmutability()` method is due to the expectation that the method `getThemes()` returns an immutable list, but actually, it returns a mutable list. This expectation is set up in the test with `assertThrows(UnsupportedOperationException.class, () -> fetchedThemes.add(new Theme()));`, which tests if adding a new `Theme` to the list `fetchedThemes` throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. However, the actual behavior is that the list allows modifications (such as adding a new element), and hence, no exception is thrown, causing the test to fail.

The business logic in the `getThemes()` method, which directly returns the `themes` list, does not include any mechanism to make this list immutable. Typically, to make a list immutable, you would wrap it using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`. The absence of such a wrapper means that `getThemes()` returns a regular, modifiable list.

To fix this issue, the `getThemes()` method should be modified to return an immutable version of the `themes` list. However, since the task specifies not to return any code, the explanation for the test failure is that the method returns a mutable list contrary to the expectations set in the unit test, which assumes that it should not allow modifications and should throw an exception when a modification is attempted.

/*
The test `testGetThemesIndependenceFromInternalState` is failing due to an issue with the list reference being returned directly from the `getThemes` method. This means when you fetch the themes using `themeList.getThemes()`, you're getting a direct reference to the internal `themes` list of `themeList`. When you subsequently modify this list by adding a new `Theme`, you are modifying the same instance that `fetchedThemes` is pointing to.

The test was intended to test for the independence of the internal state, expecting that after fetching `fetchedThemes`, modifications on the internal list (like adding `newTheme`) shouldn't affect `fetchedThemes`. However, since `getThemes()` returns the exact instance of the list, both `fetchedThemes` and the list returned by `themeList.getThemes()` point to the same object. Thus, modifications to one are directly reflected in the other.

This misunderstanding leads to the `assertEquals(1, fetchedThemes.size());` assertion failing, as the size of `fetchedThemes` will be 2 instead of 1 after adding `newTheme`. This results in the Assertion error noting the difference between the expected size (`1`) and the actual size (`2`) of the `fetchedThemes` list. 

To address this, the `getThemes` method should return a new List or clone of the internal state list, rather than a direct reference to the state. This would prevent external modifications to the returned list from affecting the internal state of the `themeList` instance.

@Tag("valid")
public void testGetThemesIndependenceFromInternalState() {
    List<Theme> initialThemes = new ArrayList<>();
    Theme theme = new Theme();
    theme.setName("Classic");
    initialThemes.add(theme);
    themeList.setThemes(initialThemes);
    List<Theme> fetchedThemes = themeList.getThemes();
    // Modify the theme list after fetching
    Theme newTheme = new Theme();
    newTheme.setName("Modern");
    themeList.getThemes().add(newTheme);
    // Should not reflect new changes
    assertEquals(1, fetchedThemes.size());
}
