================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: This method appears to be a mutator (setter) for a property 'textColor' without any specific validations or access checks. If 'textColor' is a critical property, allowing unchecked modification can lead to unauthorized alteration of data.
Solution: Consider adding access control mechanisms to validate the users making modifications and their permissions. Implementing a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) can be a solution.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If the 'textColor' is a reference to an object (Direct Object Reference) and can be manipulated from outside, this can lead to accessing unauthorized data.
Solution: Isolate critical resources by using indirect object references. Associate the users with their own list of authorized references.

Vulnerability: Poor Input Validation
Issue: The method is receiving an input of String type and assigning it to 'textColor' without any validation. If the 'textColor' property is used for critical purposes, arbitrary values or malicious payloads passed might cause unintended behaviors.
Solution: Put a strong validation mechanism that accepts only valid inputs. Using robust libraries for validation, such as Apache Commons Validator, can be considered.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test when textColor is a valid color.

Details:
  TestName: testWhenTextColorIsValid.
  Description: This test validates that the setTextColor method sets the textColor correctly when a valid color is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a valid color string.
  Act: Call the setTextColor() method with the defined color string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if setTextColor method has set the color properly.
Validation:
  The assertion will verify that the provided color string has been successfully set. This test is significant as setting color properly is vital for UI consistency.

Scenario 2: Test when textColor is null.

Details:
  TestName: testWhenTextColorIsNull.
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setTextColor method when null is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a null string.
  Act: Call the setTextColor() method with the null string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method works without throwing exceptions and sets the color to null.
Validation:
  The assertion should be that the setTextColor does not throw any exception. This is essential to avoiding NullPointerException when setting color.

Scenario 3: Test when textColor is an empty string.

Details:
  TestName: testWhenTextColorIsEmpty.
  Description: The test checks the behavior of setTextColor method when an empty string is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty string.
  Act: Call the setTextColor() method with the defined empty string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method works without throwing exceptions and sets the color to the empty string.
Validation:
  The point of the assertion is to ensure that no exceptions are thrown and that empty strings are handled gracefully by the application, preventing unwanted errors or crashes.

Scenario 4: Test when textColor is an invalid color string.

Details:
  TestName: testWhenTextColorIsInvalid.
  Description: This test checks the behavior of setTextColor method when an invalid color string is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an invalid color string (A string that does not correspond to any color).
  Act: Call the setTextColor() method with the invalid color string.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method works without throwing exceptions.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that no exceptions are thrown and that invalid strings are handled gracefully by the setTextColor method, preventing unwanted errors or crashes.

Note: This test assumes that no validation is done in the setTextColor method and that it simply sets the color. If there is internal validation and an exception is thrown for invalid cases, these negative tests (empty, invalid, null) should be updated to confirm that the expected exception is thrown.
