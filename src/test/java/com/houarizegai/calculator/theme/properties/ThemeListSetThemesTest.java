"""
Scenario 1: Test to assign the valid list of Themes to the setThemes method.
Details:
  TestName: assignValidThemesToMethod.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when passed a valid list of Themes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid list of Theme objects.
  Act: Invoke the setThemes method, providing the list.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that after the invocation, the themes field of the object matches the provided list.
Validation:
  We expect the themes field to reflect the list supplied. The aim is to verify the proper functionality of the setThemes method when provided valid input.
Scenario 2: Test to assign an empty list of Themes to the setThemes method.
Details:
  TestName: assignEmptyThemesToMethod
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setThemes method when passed an empty list of Themes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of Theme objects.
  Act: Invoke the setThemes method, providing the empty list.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that after the invocation, the themes field of the object is empty.
Validation:
  We expect the themes field to be empty as an empty list was supplied. The aim is to verify the proper functionality of the setThemes method when provided an empty list.
Scenario 3: Test to assign null to the setThemes method.
Details:
  TestName: assignNullToMethod
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setThemes method when passed null as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define null.
  Act: Invoke the setThemes method, providing null as an argument.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that after the invocation, the themes field of the object is null.
Validation:
  We expect the themes field to be null, confirming that the setThemes method can handle null values appropriately. The aim is to verify the method's behavior with null input.
Scenario 4: Test to assign a list with null elements to the setThemes method.
Details:
  TestName: assignListWithNullThemesToMethod
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the setThemes method when passed a list containing a null Theme.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new list of Theme, adding at least one null element.
  Act: Invoke the setThemes method, providing this list.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the list of themes after the setThemes invocation contains null.
Validation:
  We expect the themes field to contain null, asserting the method can handle a list with null values properly. The aim is to verify the handling of null elements within the list in the setThemes method.
