================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Object Deserialization (CWE-502)
Issue: The current code does not seem to perform any validation on the `themes` list before setting it. It might be deserialized without any safety checks which can lead to remote code execution or denial of service attacks if proper security checks are not implemented.
Solution: Implement validation checks before deserializing and setting the `themes` list. Use safe deserialization techniques when dealing with untrusted sources or wrap the list in a class that enforces type safety and restricts malicious inputs.

Vulnerability: Unauthorized Access to Function (CWE-862)
Issue: The function `setThemes` is public and there are no access controls in place to check whether the caller has the right permissions to perform this action. This can lead to unauthorized modifications to application data.
Solution: Make sure to use access controls, like user roles and permissions, to restrict access to sensitive functions like `setThemes`. Also consider making the function private or protected if it is not supposed to be accessed outside of its class or package.

Vulnerability: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition (CWE-834)
Issue: There's no check for nullity or size of the `themes` list before it is used. If `themes` is null or of an unintended size, it can cause a NullPointerException or unwanted behaviors in loops where the list is used.
Solution: Before using the `themes` list, perform nullity and size checks to make sure the object is a usable non-null list of expected size.

"""
Scenario 1: Passing a valid list of themes
Details:
  TestName: testPassingValidListOfThemes.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the method setThemes successfully sets the themes when given a valid list of themes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid list of Theme objects.
  Act: Invoke the setThemes method with the valid list of themes.
  Assert: Get the list of themes from the class and compare it to the original list of themes that was passed.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the themes were successfully set. The expected result is that the two lists of themes should match. This test confirms that the method is able to handle valid input.

Scenario 2: Passing a null list of themes
Details:
  TestName: testPassingNullListOfThemes.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the method setThemes handles a null list of themes appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the list of themes to null.
  Act: Invoke the setThemes method with null.
  Assert: Get the list of themes from the class and verify that it is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method did not throw an exception when passed a null list and that it sets the list of themes to null as well. The expected result is that the list of themes will be null. This test is important to ensure that the method handles null input gracefully.

Scenario 3: Passing an empty list of themes
Details:
  TestName: testPassingEmptyListOfThemes.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the method setThemes handles an empty list of themes appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of Theme objects.
  Act: Invoke the setThemes method with the empty list.
  Assert: Get the list of themes from the class and verify that it is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method did not throw an exception when passed an empty list and it successfully sets the list of themes to an empty list. The expected result is that the list of themes will be empty. This test is important to verify that the method can handle edge cases.
