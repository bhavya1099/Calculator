```
Scenario 1: Setting a valid color code as the numbers background

Details:
  TestName: setValidNumbersBackground
  Description: This test checks if the setNumbersBackground method correctly assigns a valid color code to the numbers background property of the Theme object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Call setNumbersBackground on the instance with a valid color code (e.g., "#FFFFFF").
  Assert: Check if getNumbersBackground returns the color code that was set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test ensures that the method correctly updates the property with a valid input, which is crucial for maintaining consistent theming across the application.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that color codes are set correctly allows for accurate theming and visual consistency in the application's user interface.

Scenario 2: Setting an empty string as the numbers background

Details:
  TestName: setEmptyNumbersBackground
  Description: This test verifies that the setNumbersBackground method can handle and set an empty string without throwing errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Call setNumbersBackground with an empty string.
  Assert: Check if getNumbersBackground returns an empty string.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test checks if the method can handle empty strings, which might represent a default or unset state in some contexts.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Handling empty strings gracefully ensures that the application can deal with incomplete or default configurations without crashing.

Scenario 3: Setting a null as the numbers background

Details:
  TestName: setNullNumbersBackground
  Description: This test examines how the setNumbersBackground method deals with null input, checking for potential exceptions or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Call setNumbersBackground with a null value.
  Assert: Check if getNumbersBackground returns null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test assesses the method's robustness in handling null inputs, which might occur during runtime due to unexpected conditions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Proper handling of null values is essential for preventing crashes and ensuring application stability when encountering incomplete data.

Scenario 4: Setting a non-color string as the numbers background

Details:
  TestName: setInvalidColorStringNumbersBackground
  Description: This test checks whether the setNumbersBackground method can handle and store a string that is not a valid color code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Call setNumbersBackground with a non-color string (e.g., "not-a-color").
  Assert: Check if getNumbersBackground returns the string "not-a-color".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test verifies that the method does not restrict inputs to valid color codes only, which might be important if the system later implements additional validation or transformation.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that the method accepts any string allows for greater flexibility in theming and might be used for error signaling or other purposes.
