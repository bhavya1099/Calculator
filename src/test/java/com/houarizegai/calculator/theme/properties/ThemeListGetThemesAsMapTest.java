================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: This vulnerability occurs when a program deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid. This could lead to code execution, denial of service, and other attacks.
Solution: Avoid deserialization of untrusted data, use safe deserialization libraries, or implement integrity checks, timeout, or resource consumption limits during deserialization.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: This vulnerability can occur when user-supplied data is not properly validated, sanitized and encoded, allowing an attacker to alter SQL statements and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
Solution: Use prepared statements with variable binding, use ORM libraries, regularly update and patch database systems.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: This vulnerability occurs when a program does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can alter the program's control flow, lead to unauthorized access, trigger code execution or compromise system data.
Solution: Ensure that your program includes proper input validation mechanisms. Use strong type checking, regular expressions or custom validation functions.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test the method when the themes has multiple different Theme instances.

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesAsMapWithDifferentThemes
  Description: This test will check the functionality when the themes list contains different Theme instances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up different Theme instances and add them to the themes list.
  Act: Invoke the target method getThemesAsMap.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the actual size and contents of the returned map with the expected map.
Validation:
   This will aim to verify the method's ability to map all different Theme instances from the list to a map, with the Theme's name as key and the Theme instance as value.

Scenario 2: Test the method with an empty themes list.

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesAsMapWithEmptyList
  Description: The test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the themes list is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the themes list is empty.
  Act: Invoke the getThemesAsMap method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned map is also empty.
Validation:
  This will verify that the method can handle an empty input list, and it just returns an empty map without any crashes or unexpected behaviors.

Scenario 3: Test the method with themes having Themes with duplicate names

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesAsMapWithDuplicateThemeNames
  Description: This test will check the functionality when the themes list contains Themes with the same name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up several Theme instances with the same name and add them to the themes list.
  Act: Invoke the getThemesAsMap() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the actual size and contents of the returned map with the expected map.
Validation:
  This test will verify whether the method handles duplicate theme names correctly. Since a map can't have duplicate keys, it should only contain the last occurrence of a key in the themes list.

Scenario 4: Test the method with null themes list.

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesAsMapWithNullList
  Description: The test is meant to check the behavior of the method when the themes list is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the themes list to null.
  Act: Invoke the getThemesAsMap method.
  Assert: Expect the method to throw a NullPointerException, handle this in the test.
Validation:
  This will verify that the method throws a null pointer exception when it tries to access a null object, as it can't handle null lists.

Scenario 5: Test the method with a large themes list.

Details:
  TestName: testGetThemesAsMapWithLargeSize
  Description: This test is meant to analyze the behavior of the method with a large themes list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a large number of Theme instances with unique names and add them to the themes list.
  Act: Invoke the getThemesAsMap method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to ensure that all the entries from the themes list are present in the returned map.
Validation:
  This will verify whether the method performs efficiently and accurately when handling large data inputs.
