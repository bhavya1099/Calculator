Scenario 4: Test when the themes list contains duplicate elements
Details:  
  TestName: testGetThemesAsMapWithDuplicateElements
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the getThemesAsMap() method when the themes list contains duplicate elements. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a themes list with multiple themes, including duplicates.
    Act: Invoke the getThemesAsMap() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned map contains an entry for each unique theme in the themes list, with the theme's name as the key and the theme as the value. Duplicates should be ignored.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the map returned by the getThemesAsMap() method correctly maps each unique theme's name to the corresponding theme, and ignores duplicates. This test is important to ensure that the method correctly handles the edge case of a themes list with duplicate elements.

The provided test cases seem correct and should not produce any compilation errors given the associated class ThemeListGetThemesAsMapTest method details. The error message you've provided is too generic and does not provide any specific information about which part of the code is causing the compilation error.
However, I would suggest to check the following:
- Ensure that the `Theme` class ThemeListGetThemesAsMapTest properly imported in the test class.
- Ensure that the `Theme` class ThemeListGetThemesAsMapTest its methods (`getName`, `setName`) are correctly defined and accessible from the test class.
- Ensure that there are no syntax errors or unresolved references in the test code.
If the error persists, please provide a more specific error message or the part of the code that is causing the error to assist you better.
