"""
 Scenario 1: Name is set and Retrieved Successfully 

 Details:  
    TestName: nameSetAndGetSuccessfully.
    Description: This test is meant to check the getName() method when a valid name has been set. The primary test scenario is when the name is non-null and non-empty. 
    Execution:
    Arrange: an instance of the class is created and the name field is set to a non-null and non-empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method.
    Assert: Use assertEquals() to verify that the returned value matches the value previously given to the name field.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to confirm that the getName() method correctly retrieves the name that was previously set. 
    This test is significant as it validates that the getter and setter methods for the 'name' attribute are functioning correctly.

 Scenario 2: Name is Not Set 

Details:  
    TestName: nameNotSet.
    Description: This test is to check the getName() method when no name has been set. The target scenario is when the name has its initial null value.
    Execution:
    Arrange: an instance of the class is created and the name field is not set.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method.
    Assert: Use assertNull() to verify that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to confirm that the getName() method correctly returns null when no name has been set.
    This test is significant as it validates the nullability and initialization state of 'name' attribute, ensuring default values are correctly assigned and retrieved.

 Scenario 3: Name is empty

 Details:  
    TestName: nameIsEmpty.
    Description: The purpose of this test is to check the getName() method when the name is an empty string.
    Execution:
    Arrange: an instance of the class is created and name is set to "".
    Act: Invoke the getName() method.
    Assert: Use assertEquals() to check that the returned value is "".
  Validation:  
    This assertion verifies that the getName() method correctly returns an empty string when the name has been set to "".
    This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior with "empty" input, hence testing a possible edge case.
