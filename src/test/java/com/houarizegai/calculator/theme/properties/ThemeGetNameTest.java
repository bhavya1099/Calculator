### Test Scenarios for the `getName` Method of the `Theme` Entity

---

**Scenario 1: Valid Name Retrieval**

Details:
  TestName: retrieveValidThemeName
  Description: To verify that the `getName` method accurately returns the theme's name that has been previously set using `setName`. This test checks the method's basic retrieval function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Theme and use `setName` to set a known name "DarkMode".
  Act: Call the `getName` method to retrieve the set name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name matches the name set "DarkMode".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that `getName` returns the exact name set by `setName`. This is critical to ensure data integrity and that the encapsulated field access via `getName` works correctly.

---

**Scenario 2: Default Name Value Before Setting**

Details:
  TestName: retrieveDefaultName
  Description: This test aims to check the default return value of the `getName` method when `setName` has not been called on the Theme instance, assuming the default constructor initializes name to null or some default state. This scenario checks the behavior of uninitialized string fields in Java.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Theme without setting the name.
  Act: Call the `getName` method to retrieve the name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name is either null or an expected default value (e.g., an empty string, if designed that way).
Validation:
  This test verifies that `getName` handles uninitialized states gracefully, a common situation in applications ensuring robustness against null-pointer exceptions or incorrect data display.

---

**Scenario 3: Name After Repeated Setting**

Details:
  TestName: retrieveNameAfterMultipleSets
  Description: To determine if the `getName` method returns the latest value set by `setName`, particularly after the name has been changed multiple times. This test addresses potential issues in state management within the Theme class where successive writes might not update the state appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Theme, set the theme name to "DarkMode", then update it to "LightMode".
  Act: Fetch the name using `getName`.
  Assert: Ensure the returned name is the last value set, "LightMode".
Validation:
  This scenario confirms that `getName` accurately reflects the most recent state of the name field. Ensuring that changes in state over time are accurately captured and retrievable is vital for dynamic theme changes in applications.

---

**Scenario 4: Concurrent Access on Name**

Details:
  TestName: accessNameFromMultipleThreads
  Description: Checks if the `getName` method consistently returns the correct name when accessed from multiple threads. This scenario is particularly significant in multi-threaded environments where concurrent reads could lead to inconsistent or corrupted data if not handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the theme's name to "UniversalTheme" in the main thread. Start multiple threads to read the theme name using `getName`.
  Act: Each thread retrieves the name.
  Assert: All threads should assert that the name they retrieve is "UniversalTheme".
Validation:
  Verifying that the `getName` method can handle concurrent accesses ensures thread safety of the Theme class. This scenario tests the method under a stress scenario that might emulate real-world usage in a multi-threaded application environment, ensuring data consistency across threads.

---

These scenarios aim to thoroughly test the `getName` method's functionality and robustness, ensuring that it behaves as expected in various conditions and use cases relevant to application development.
