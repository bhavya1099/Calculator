Scenario 1: Setting a Valid Name

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithValidString
  Description: This test verifies that the setName method correctly assigns a valid string to the name field of a Theme object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with a valid string "Dark Mode".
  Assert: Use getName to verify that the name field is updated to "Dark Mode".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the name field holds the string "Dark Mode" after the setName method is called. This test is significant as it confirms that the setter method properly updates the object's state with valid input.

Scenario 2: Setting a Null Name

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithNull
  Description: This test checks how the setName method handles null input, ensuring that it does not throw an exception and sets the name field to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with a null value.
  Assert: Use getName to confirm that the name field is set to null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the name field is null, asserting the method's ability to handle null inputs gracefully. This scenario is important for understanding the method's behavior with non-standard (null) inputs, which might be a common case if user input is involved.

Scenario 3: Setting an Empty String Name

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithEmptyString
  Description: This test ensures that the setName method can handle an empty string without errors and correctly updates the name field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with an empty string "".
  Assert: Use getName to check that the name field is set to an empty string.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's robustness in handling empty strings, which are technically valid inputs. The ability to handle empty strings is crucial for ensuring the application's stability in scenarios where inputs might be inadvertently cleared or left empty.

Scenario 4: Setting a Name with Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: setNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test verifies that the setName method can handle strings containing special characters without any issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with a string containing special characters, e.g., "Night@Mode#2023!".
  Assert: Use getName to confirm that the name field correctly reflects the input string with special characters.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the name field accurately stores strings with special characters, which is important for supporting a wide range of name inputs, including those with non-alphanumeric characters. This reflects the application's flexibility in handling diverse user inputs.

Scenario 5: Re-setting a Name to a New Value

Details:
  TestName: resetNameToNewValue
  Description: This test checks the setName method's behavior when called multiple times on the same object to change the name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Theme class and set an initial name "Initial Mode".
  Act: Invoke the setName method again to set a new name "Updated Mode".
  Assert: Use getName to verify that the name field is updated to "Updated Mode".
Validation:
  The test validates that the setName method can be used to update the name field multiple times, which is crucial for scenarios where the theme's name might need to be changed dynamically based on user preferences or other conditions. This ensures the method's reliability and flexibility in real-world applications.
