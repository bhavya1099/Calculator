""" 
Scenario 1: Testing setName using a valid string

Details:  
  TestName: setValidName
  Description: This test is meant to check if setName method is correctly setting the given valid string as the name attribute of the associated object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as it's just a simple assignment operation.
  Act: Invoke setName method with a valid string parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the actual name attribute of the associated object matches with the string parameter passed in the setName method.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the parameter passed in setName method is correctly set as name attribute. If so, it confirms that the method is performing as expected.

""" 

""" 
Scenario 2: Testing setName with a null string

Details:  
  TestName: setNullName
  Description: This test is meant to check how setName method is handling the scenario when a null string is passed as parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as it's just a simple assignment operation.
  Act: Invoke setName method with null string parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the actual name attribute of the associated object is now null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the parameter passed in setName method is correctly set as name attribute (in this case null). If so, it proves that the method is capable of handling null values.

""" 

""" 
Scenario 3: Testing setName with an empty string

Details:  
  TestName: setEmptyName
  Description: This test is meant to check how setName method is handling the scenario when an empty string is passed as parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as it's just a simple assignment operation.
  Act: Invoke setName method with an empty string parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the actual name attribute of the associated object is now an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the parameter passed in setName method is correctly set as name attribute (in this instance, an empty string). If the method is able to set the name to an empty string, it indicates that it can handle such situations effectively.

""" 

""" 
Scenario 4: Testing setName with a very long string

Details:  
  TestName: setLongName
  Description: This test is intended to check how the setName method can handle very long strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to setup any data as it's just a simple assignment operation.
  Act: Invoke setName method with a very long string parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the actual name attribute of the associated object matches the long string passed as parameter.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify if the parameter passed in setName method is correctly set as name attribute (in this case a very long string). If successful, it indicates that the method can handle long strings appropriately.
