Based on the provided information, here are some test scenarios for the `getTextColor()` method of the Theme entity:

```
Scenario 1: Retrieve Text Color Successfully

Details:
  TestName: retrieveTextColor
  Description: Verify that the getTextColor method returns the correct text color value that was set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Theme object and set a specific text color using the setTextColor method.
  Act: Call the getTextColor method on the Theme object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned color matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getTextColor method correctly retrieves the text color value that was previously set. It validates the basic functionality of storing and retrieving the text color property of a Theme.

Scenario 2: Default Text Color Value

Details:
  TestName: defaultTextColor
  Description: Check if the getTextColor method returns null or a default value when no text color has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Theme object without setting any text color.
  Act: Call the getTextColor method on the Theme object.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is null or a predefined default value (if applicable).
Validation:
  This test verifies the behavior of getTextColor when no text color has been explicitly set. It helps ensure that the method handles the default state correctly, which is important for initializing new Theme objects.

Scenario 3: Text Color After Multiple Sets

Details:
  TestName: textColorAfterMultipleSets
  Description: Ensure that getTextColor returns the most recently set text color when the color has been changed multiple times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Theme object and set the text color multiple times using setTextColor.
  Act: Call getTextColor after the final color set.
  Assert: Verify that the returned color matches the last color that was set.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getTextColor method always returns the most up-to-date text color value, even after multiple changes. It validates the method's ability to reflect the current state of the Theme object accurately.

Scenario 4: Consistency with Other Theme Properties

Details:
  TestName: textColorConsistencyWithTheme
  Description: Verify that getTextColor returns a value consistent with other theme properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Theme object and set various properties including text color, application background, and button colors.
  Act: Call getTextColor and other getter methods.
  Assert: Verify that the returned text color is logically consistent with other theme colors (e.g., contrasts with background color).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the text color returned by getTextColor is part of a coherent theme. While it doesn't directly test the method's functionality, it verifies that the text color property works correctly within the context of the entire Theme object.

Scenario 5: Text Color Immutability

Details:
  TestName: textColorImmutability
  Description: Ensure that modifying the returned value from getTextColor does not affect the stored text color.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Theme object and set a specific text color.
  Act: Get the text color using getTextColor, attempt to modify the returned String (if possible), then call getTextColor again.
  Assert: Verify that the second call to getTextColor returns the original color, unaffected by any attempted modifications to the first returned value.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getTextColor method returns a value that cannot be used to directly modify the Theme's internal state. It ensures the integrity and encapsulation of the Theme object's properties.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `getTextColor()` method, including basic functionality, default behavior, consistency with other properties, and data integrity. They aim to thoroughly test the method within the constraints of the provided Theme entity structure.
