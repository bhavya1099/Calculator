================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through Getter (CWE-359)
Issue: The method getTextColor() might allow any user or process to read its value. This might lead to unintended information disclosure or data leak, especially if the field 'textColor' contains sensitive data.
Solution: If 'textColor' contains sensitive data, consider employing an access control mechanism to the getter method, or avoid exposing the sensitive data directly. You can encode or encrypt the data before returning it.

Vulnerability: Missing access modifiers in class and method (CWE-905)
Issue: The access modifier for the class and method are not explicitly defined. That could expose them to unexpected accesses and manipulations.
Solution: Ensure to define the necessary access modifiers appropriately. If the class and methods are intended to be accessible only within its package, use 'package-private' access modifier. If intended to be accessed everywhere, use 'public'.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validate correct return of the textColor variable.

Details:
  TestName: testCorrectTextColorReturn
  Description: This scenario is designed to verify that the getTextColor method is properly returning the value assigned to the textColor variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a specific color value for the textColor variable.
  Act: Call the getTextColor method.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the assigned textColor value.
Validation:
  This asserts that the getTextColor method is working correctly and is properly retrieving the value of the textColor variable. It is important for the display functionality of the application, as it verifies the text color setting.

Scenario 2: Testing for null value of textColor.

Details:
  TestName: testNullTextColorReturn
  Description: This scenario is designed to verify that the getTextColor method correctly handles null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the textColor to be null.
  Act: Call the getTextColor method.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  This test is important for preventing null pointer exceptions in the application. If getTextColor can correctly handle null return, it reduces chances of future crashes or bugs.

Scenario 3: Test empty value return.

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyTextColorReturn
  Description: This scenario validates that the getTextColor method correctly handles when textColor is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the textColor variable as an empty string.
  Act: Call the getTextColor method.
  Assert: Check that getTextColor returns an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is significant for validating the method's handling of edge case scenarios. If textColor is set as an empty string, the application should handle it gracefully by returning an empty string, maintaining application stability.

Scenario 4: Test for non-color string value.

Details:
  TestName: testNonColorStringTextColorReturn
  Description: This scenario validates that the getTextColor method correctly handles when textColor is not a color value string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the textColor variable to a non-color string.
  Act: Invoke the getTextColor method.
  Assert: Check that getTextColor returns the non-color string value assigned to textColor.
Validation:
  This test looks at another edge case where the text color may be set to a non-color value. The application should handle it correctly, reflecting the flexibility and robustness of the getTextColor method in different contexts.
