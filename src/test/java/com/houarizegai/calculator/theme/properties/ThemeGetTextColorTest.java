```markdown
Scenario 1: Validate correct text color retrieval

Details:
  TestName: validateCorrectTextColorRetrieval
  Description: This test checks if the getTextColor method correctly returns the value of textColor that was previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Theme and use setTextColor to assign a known color value.
  Act: Call the getTextColor method on the Theme instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned color matches the color set during the Arrange step.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the textColor returned by getTextColor is exactly what was set, ensuring the getter's functionality and data integrity.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is crucial to confirm that the Theme class handles text color information correctly, which is vital for UI consistency in an application.

Scenario 2: Validate getTextColor with default value

Details:
  TestName: validateTextColorDefaultValue
  Description: This test verifies that the getTextColor method returns null or a default value when no value has been explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Theme without setting textColor.
  Act: Call the getTextColor method on the newly created Theme instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is null or a predefined default (if applicable).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the default behavior of getTextColor is to return null or a default value, which is important for understanding the initial state of a Theme object.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that the getTextColor method handles uninitialized states properly allows developers to avoid null pointer exceptions and other errors in the application.

Scenario 3: Validate text color consistency after multiple updates

Details:
  TestName: validateTextColorConsistencyAfterUpdates
  Description: This test ensures that the getTextColor method consistently returns the most recent textColor value after multiple updates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Theme and set textColor multiple times to different values.
  Act: Retrieve the textColor after the final update using getTextColor.
  Assert: Confirm that the textColor returned matches the last value set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that getTextColor accurately reflects the most recent value assigned to textColor, even after several changes.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This scenario is essential to ensure that Theme instances correctly track changes over time, which is critical for dynamic theme adjustments in an application.
```
These scenarios cover basic functionality, default behavior, and consistency checks for the `getTextColor` method in the Theme class, providing a robust foundation for further testing and development.
