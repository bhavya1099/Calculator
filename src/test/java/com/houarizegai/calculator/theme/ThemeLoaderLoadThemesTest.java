"""
Scenario 1: Successful loading of themes from the YAML file
Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulLoadingOfThemes
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method successfully loads and returns the map of themes from the YAML file.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper and File classes and the readValue method to return a ThemeList object with some predefined themes.
  Act: Invoke the loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map is not empty and contains the predefined themes.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method successfully loads and returns the themes from the YAML file. This is significant as it ensures that the application can correctly load its theme configurations.
Scenario 2: IOException handling when the YAML file is not found
Details:
  TestName: testIOExceptionHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles an IOException, which could occur if the YAML file is not found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper and File classes and the readValue method to throw an IOException.
  Act: Invoke the loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles an IOException by returning an empty map. This is significant as it ensures that the application can gracefully handle errors when loading theme configurations.
Scenario 3: Successful loading of themes when the YAML file is empty
Details:
  TestName: testLoadingOfThemesFromEmptyFile
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a scenario where the YAML file is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper and File classes and the readValue method to return a ThemeList object with no themes.
  Act: Invoke the loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles an empty YAML file by returning an empty map. This is significant as it ensures that the application does not crash when the theme configurations are missing.
