```
Scenario 1: Successfully Load Themes from YAML File

Details:
  TestName: loadThemesSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies that the loadThemes method correctly parses the YAML file and successfully loads the themes into a Map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper to return a predefined ThemeList object when readValue is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is not empty and contains the expected themes.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the Map returned by loadThemes contains the themes defined in the mocked ThemeList. This test is significant because it confirms that the method can parse a well-formed YAML file and correctly transform it into a usable Map of Theme objects.

Scenario 2: Handle IOException during Theme Loading

Details:
  TestName: handleIOExceptionWhenLoadingThemes
  Description: This test ensures that the loadThemes method returns an empty Map when an IOException occurs during file reading.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the ObjectMapper to throw an IOException when the readValue method is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an empty Map is returned when an IOException is encountered. This test is crucial for ensuring the method's robustness and its ability to handle errors gracefully without crashing the application.

Scenario 3: Handle Empty or Corrupt YAML File

Details:
  TestName: handleEmptyOrCorruptYAMLFile
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the loadThemes method when the YAML file is empty or corrupted, resulting in a null or invalid ThemeList object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper to return null or an invalid ThemeList object when readValue is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to check that the method handles cases where the YAML file does not result in a valid ThemeList. It's important to verify that the method can handle such scenarios gracefully, ensuring the application's stability.

Scenario 4: YAML File with No Themes

Details:
  TestName: loadThemesWithNoThemesInFile
  Description: This test scenario checks if the loadThemes method can handle a YAML file that contains a ThemeList without any themes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper to return a ThemeList object with an empty Map when readValue is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is empty.
Validation:
  This test validates that the loadThemes method correctly processes a YAML file with an empty list of themes, returning an empty Map as expected. It ensures that the method correctly interprets the absence of themes as a normal scenario and not an error condition.

public class ThemeLoaderLoadThemesTest {

The failure in the test `loadThemesSuccessfully` is primarily due to a mismatch between the expected and actual results when invoking the `loadThemes` method of the `ThemeLoader` class. The test expects a map containing only one theme, "Dark", but the actual result contains two themes: "Dark" and "Light". This discrepancy leads to the assertion failure.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. **Mock Setup**: The test mocks the `ObjectMapper` and `ThemeList` to return a predefined set of themes when `loadThemes` is called. Specifically, it sets up the mocked `ObjectMapper` to return a `ThemeList` which, when `getThemesAsMap()` is called on it, returns a map with a single entry: `"Dark"` mapped to a new `Theme` instance.

2. **Method Invocation**: The `loadThemes` method in `ThemeLoader` is designed to load themes from a YAML file located in `src/main/resources/application.yaml`. This method uses an `ObjectMapper` to read the file and convert its content to a `ThemeList` object, which is then transformed into a map of themes.

3. **Assertion**: The test checks that the map returned by `loadThemes` is not empty and that it equals the expected map containing only the "Dark" theme.

4. **Failure Point**: The test fails because the actual implementation of `loadThemes` does not use the mocked `ObjectMapper` but instead creates a new one inside the method. Therefore, it attempts to read the actual `application.yaml` file. If this file contains more themes (as the error suggests, it includes both "Dark" and "Light" themes), the output map will not match the expected map created in the test setup.

5. **Resolution**: To make the test pass, you would either need to adjust the test expectations to match the actual content of `application.yaml` or modify the implementation of `loadThemes` to allow dependency injection of the `ObjectMapper`, thereby using the mocked mapper set up in the test.

This explanation clarifies that the test failure is due to the discrepancy between the hardcoded mock expectations in the test and the actual data being loaded by the method under test, which is not influenced by the mocked objects due to the internal instantiation of dependencies within the method.

@Tag("valid")
public void loadThemesSuccessfully() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    ThemeList mockedThemeList = Mockito.mock(ThemeList.class);
    Map<String, Theme> expectedThemes = Collections.singletonMap("Dark", new Theme());
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenReturn(mockedThemeList);
        when(mockedThemeList.getThemesAsMap()).thenReturn(expectedThemes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Failed to mock dependencies properly.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertFalse(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes should not be empty.");
    assertEquals(expectedThemes, actualThemes, "The themes loaded do not match the expected themes.");

The test failure in the `handleIOExceptionWhenLoadingThemes` method is primarily due to the test's inability to correctly simulate the behavior of the `loadThemes` method when an `IOException` occurs. The test is designed to verify that an empty map is returned when an `IOException` is thrown during the reading of the YAML file. However, the test fails because the actual implementation of the `loadThemes` method is not being influenced by the mocked behavior defined in the test.

Here's a breakdown of what's likely causing the issue:

1. **Mock Setup Incomplete**: The `ObjectMapper` instance `mockedMapper` is created and a behavior is defined to throw an `IOException` when its `readValue` method is called. However, this mocked instance is not used in the `loadThemes` method. The actual implementation in `loadThemes` creates a new `ObjectMapper` instance internally and uses it to read the file. This internal creation of the `ObjectMapper` is not affected by the mocked setup in the test, hence the `IOException` is never actually thrown during the test.

2. **Static Method Testing Difficulty**: The method `loadThemes` is static. Testing static methods can be challenging because they often are not designed with dependency injection in mind, making it hard to substitute dependencies like `ObjectMapper` with mocks.

3. **Incorrect Assertion**: The test expects that the map returned by `loadThemes` should be empty (`assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty())`). However, since the `IOException` is not thrown as expected (due to the reasons mentioned above), the method does not return an empty map but proceeds with its normal execution, which likely results in a non-empty map, causing the assertion to fail.

To address this issue, the test needs to be adapted to either use a method that allows injecting mock dependencies or use another approach to simulate the `IOException`. Alternatively, the design of the `loadThemes` method could be changed to be more testable, such as by not creating the `ObjectMapper` inside the method but rather passing it as a parameter or using a factory that can be mocked in tests.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void handleIOExceptionWhenLoadingThemes() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenThrow(new IOException("Failed to read file."));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Mocking failed.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes map should be empty on IOException.");
}

The test failure in the `handleEmptyOrCorruptYAMLFile` method is due to a discrepancy in the expected behavior of the `ThemeLoader.loadThemes()` method when dealing with an empty or corrupt YAML file. According to the test's assertion, the method is expected to return an empty map if the YAML file is corrupt or empty. However, the actual behavior does not align with this expectation, resulting in the test failure.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Mocking Behavior**: In the test, an `ObjectMapper` is mocked to return `null` when attempting to read from any file. This is intended to simulate the behavior when the YAML file is unreadable or corrupt.

2. **Implementation of `loadThemes()`**: The `loadThemes()` method in the `ThemeLoader` class is designed to catch `IOExceptions` and return an empty map in such cases. However, if the `ObjectMapper` returns `null` (as set up by the mocking behavior), the method does not handle this `null` scenario explicitly. The method attempts to call `getThemesAsMap()` on a `null` object (`themeList`), which should ideally be handled to still return an empty map, but it seems that this scenario might not be handled, leading to an unexpected map content.

3. **Test Assertion**: The test asserts that `actualThemes.isEmpty()` should be `true`. The failure message indicates that the actual result was not an empty map, suggesting that either the map contained items or was not properly initialized to be empty as expected under error conditions.

4. **Error Analysis**: The error message from the test execution log, `org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Themes map should be empty if YAML file is corrupt or empty. ==> expected: <true> but was: <false>`, confirms that the map returned by `loadThemes()` was not empty when it should have been. This could be due to not adequately handling the scenario where the `ObjectMapper` returns `null` or due to some items being incorrectly added to the map despite the error.

To resolve this test failure, it is essential to ensure that the `loadThemes()` method correctly handles the case where `themeList` is `null`, perhaps by checking for `null` before attempting to use the `themeList` object. This would ensure that an empty map is returned consistently in error scenarios, aligning with the test's expectations and preventing such failures.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void handleEmptyOrCorruptYAMLFile() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenReturn(null);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Failed to mock dependencies properly.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes map should be empty if YAML file is corrupt or empty.");
}

The test failure in the `loadThemesWithNoThemesInFile` test method is due to the fact that the actual implementation of the `loadThemes()` method in the `ThemeLoader` class is not being intercepted or affected by the mocking setup in the test. The test method sets up mocks for `ObjectMapper` and `ThemeList` to simulate a scenario where no themes are loaded from the file, expecting an empty map to be returned. However, the `loadThemes()` method in the `ThemeLoader` class directly reads from an actual file "src/main/resources/application.yaml" using a new instance of `ObjectMapper` that is not mocked.

Since the `loadThemes()` method creates a new `ObjectMapper` and reads directly from the file system, it does not use the mocked `ObjectMapper` instance provided in the test. As a result, the method does not return the expected empty map as set up by the test mocks but instead attempts to read the themes from the actual file, leading to the assertion failure where the test expects an empty map but gets whatever is the content of the actual file.

To resolve this issue, the test should either modify the design to allow injecting a mock `ObjectMapper` into the `loadThemes()` method or utilize an integration testing approach where the file contents are controlled as part of the test setup. Alternatively, the method could be refactored to support dependency injection, allowing for easier mocking and testing.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void loadThemesWithNoThemesInFile() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    ThemeList mockedThemeList = Mockito.mock(ThemeList.class);
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenReturn(mockedThemeList);
        when(mockedThemeList.getThemesAsMap()).thenReturn(Collections.emptyMap());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Failed to mock dependencies properly.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes map should be empty if no themes are present in the file.");
