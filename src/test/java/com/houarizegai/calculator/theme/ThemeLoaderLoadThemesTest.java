"""
  Scenario 1: Successful Theme Loading

  Details:
    TestName: testLoadThemesSuccessfully.
    Description: The test checks that themes can be loaded successfully from the YAML file and that the resulting map contains the expected themes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid YAML file with sample themes in the location 'src/main/resources/application.yaml'.
    Act: Call loadThemes()
    Assert: Verify that the returned Map is not empty and that it contains the expected themes.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the themes are correctly read and mapped from the YAML file. Successful execution of the test indicates the errorless functionality of the loadThemes method when loading an existing and correctly formatted YAML file.

  Scenario 2: Non-existent YAML File

  Details:
    TestName: testLoadThemesWithMissingFile.
    Description: The test checks that an empty map is returned when the YAML file does not exist.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure there is no file at 'src/main/resources/application.yaml'.
    Act: Call loadThemes()
    Assert: Verify that the returned Map is empty.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates whether the loadThemes method correctly handles scenarios where the YAML file does not exist, by returning an empty map. This is important for the application's resilience, as configuration files may not always be available or correctly placed.

  Scenario 3: Incorrectly Formatted YAML file

  Details:
    TestName: testLoadThemesWithIncorrectlyFormattedFile.
    Description: The test checks that an empty map is returned when the YAML file is formatted incorrectly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an incorrectly formatted YAML file at 'src/main/resources/application.yaml'.
    Act: Call loadThemes()
    Assert: Verify that the returned Map is empty.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates whether the loadThemes method correctly handles scenarios where there are errors reading or parsing the YAML file, by returning an empty map. This is important for error handling as configuration files may not always be correctly formatted.
