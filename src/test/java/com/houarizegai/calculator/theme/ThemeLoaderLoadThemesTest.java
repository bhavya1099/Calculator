================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The mapper.readValue() function is reading data directly from a file ('src/main/resources/application.yaml') whose path appears to be hardcoded. An attacker may exploit this if they find a way to replace or manipulate the data in your 'application.yaml' file, leading to potential harmful actions with escalated privileges.
Solution: Keep sensitive data out of the source code. Store it elsewhere and use secure methods to access it, e.g., environment variables or secure dedicated configuration servers, and include appropriate file read exception handling. Alternatively, use classpath resources which are safer and more portable.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The catch block for the IOException does not do anything. This can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities as it can fail silently and attackers could take advantage of this to get information about the structure of your code, find or confirm exploits.
Solution: Log the exception and handle it properly. If something goes wrong when reading the file, initiate a recovery action or propagate the error up the call stack for a higher layer to resolve. It is recommended to use a well-known logging framework.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The use of method 'findAndRegisterModules()' is generally associated with special transformations or conversions between types which could open up a door for an attacker to pass insecure data.
Solution: Ensure the method 'findAndRegisterModules()' is actually needed in a production setting. If it is needed, ensure that each registered module is reviewed for security. Modules should only be registered if necessary. Unregister any unnecessary modules.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid resources path and valid Themes on YAML file
  TestName: testValidResourcesPathAndValidThemes
  Description: Should correctly populate the map from the valid YAML files under src/main/resources/application.yaml with defined themes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock ThemeList with predefined Theme objects. Mock ObjectMapper's readValue method to return the mocked ThemeList.
    Act: Call the method loadThemes.
    Assert: Assert that map returned is not null and not empty and has the correct Themes.
  Validation:
    Asserting here that if application.yaml contains valid Theme details, they are correctly loaded into a map. This validates the normal running of the application which should retrieve Theme information correctly from the application.yaml file.

Scenario 2: Valid resources path but no Themes in YAML file
  TestName: testValidResourcesPathButNoThemes
  Description: Checking the scenario where the path exists but there are no themes defined in the YAML file.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock ThemeList with no Theme objects. Mock ObjectMapper's readValue method to return the mocked ThemeList.
    Act: Call the method loadThemes.
    Assert: Assert that map returned is not null and is empty.
  Validation:
    Asserting here that even if there are no Theme items in the application.yaml file, the method should handle this gracefully and simply return an empty map. This ensures the method can handle variabilities in the application.yaml file.

Scenario 3: IOException Scenario
  TestName: testIOExceptionScenario
  Description: To handle the scenario where an IOException is thrown when trying to read the YAML file.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock ObjectMapper's readValue method to throw IOException.
    Act: Call the method loadThemes.
    Assert: Assert that returned value should be not null and an empty map.
  Validation:
    Asserting here that even when an IOException occurs, indicating an issue with reading the file, possibly due to missing file or insufficient permissions, the method should handle the exception and return an empty Map, ensuring graceful degradation in error scenarios.

Scenario 4: Null Resources Path
  TestName: testNullResourcesPath
  Description: Checks the scenario where the resources path is null or does not exist.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock ObjectMapper's readValue method to throw FileNotFoundException.
    Act: Call the method loadThemes.
    Assert: Assert that returned value should be not null and an empty map.
  Validation:
    Asserting here that even when a FileNotFoundException occurs, indicating that the resource path is non-existent, the method should handle the exception and return an empty Map, ensuring error handling is correctly implemented.
