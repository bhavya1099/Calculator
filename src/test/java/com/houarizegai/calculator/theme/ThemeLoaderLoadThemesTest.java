```
Scenario 1: Successfully Load Themes from YAML File

Details:
  TestName: loadThemesSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies that the loadThemes method correctly parses the YAML file and successfully loads the themes into a Map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper to return a predefined ThemeList object when readValue is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is not empty and contains the expected themes.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the Map returned by loadThemes contains the themes defined in the mocked ThemeList. This test is significant because it confirms that the method can parse a well-formed YAML file and correctly transform it into a usable Map of Theme objects.

Scenario 2: Handle IOException during Theme Loading

Details:
  TestName: handleIOExceptionWhenLoadingThemes
  Description: This test ensures that the loadThemes method returns an empty Map when an IOException occurs during file reading.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the ObjectMapper to throw an IOException when the readValue method is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an empty Map is returned when an IOException is encountered. This test is crucial for ensuring the method's robustness and its ability to handle errors gracefully without crashing the application.

Scenario 3: Handle Empty or Corrupt YAML File

Details:
  TestName: handleEmptyOrCorruptYAMLFile
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the loadThemes method when the YAML file is empty or corrupted, resulting in a null or invalid ThemeList object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper to return null or an invalid ThemeList object when readValue is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to check that the method handles cases where the YAML file does not result in a valid ThemeList. It's important to verify that the method can handle such scenarios gracefully, ensuring the application's stability.

Scenario 4: YAML File with No Themes

Details:
  TestName: loadThemesWithNoThemesInFile
  Description: This test scenario checks if the loadThemes method can handle a YAML file that contains a ThemeList without any themes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ObjectMapper to return a ThemeList object with an empty Map when readValue is called.
  Act: Call the ThemeLoader.loadThemes method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Map is empty.
Validation:
  This test validates that the loadThemes method correctly processes a YAML file with an empty list of themes, returning an empty Map as expected. It ensures that the method correctly interprets the absence of themes as a normal scenario and not an error condition.

public class ThemeLoaderLoadThemesTest {

The failure in the test `loadThemesSuccessfully` is primarily due to a mismatch between the expected and actual results when invoking the `loadThemes` method of the `ThemeLoader` class. The test expects a map containing only one theme, "Dark", but the actual result contains two themes: "Dark" and "Light". This discrepancy leads to the assertion failure.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. **Mock Setup**: The test sets up mocks for `ObjectMapper` and `ThemeList`. It configures the `ObjectMapper` to return a mocked `ThemeList` when it reads values from any file of type `ThemeList.class`. It further configures the mocked `ThemeList` to return a predefined map containing only one theme ("Dark") when `getThemesAsMap()` is called.

2. **Method Invocation**: The `loadThemes` method of `ThemeLoader` is invoked. This method is expected to read theme data from a YAML file and convert this data into a map of theme names to `Theme` objects. However, the actual business logic in `loadThemes()` reads from a fixed file path ("src/main/resources/application.yaml") and is supposed to handle any `IOException` by returning an empty map. This method does not use the mocked `ObjectMapper` because it creates a new `ObjectMapper` instance directly within the method.

3. **Assertion Failure**: The test fails at the assertion step where it checks if the actual themes map matches the expected map. The failure message indicates that the actual map returned from `loadThemes()` contains an unexpected "Light" theme along with a "Dark" theme, and even the instance of "Dark" theme does not match the expected one (different object references).

4. **Root Cause**: The primary issue here is that the `loadThemes` method in `ThemeLoader` is not designed to use an injected dependency (like a mocked `ObjectMapper`). It creates its own `ObjectMapper` and reads directly from a file, which means it does not interact with the mocked `ObjectMapper` set up in the test. This results in the method not behaving as controlled by the test setup, leading to the observed failure.

5. **Potential Solution**: To make this unit test work as intended, the design of the `ThemeLoader` class and its `loadThemes` method would need to be adjusted to allow dependency injection (e.g., passing an `ObjectMapper` as a parameter). This change would enable the method to use the mocked `ObjectMapper` during tests, providing control over its output and allowing the test to validate the logic effectively.

In summary, the test fails due to a design limitation in the `ThemeLoader` class that does not support dependency injection, causing the method to execute with its actual logic instead of the mocked behavior expected by the test.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void loadThemesSuccessfully() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    ThemeList mockedThemeList = Mockito.mock(ThemeList.class);
    Map<String, Theme> expectedThemes = Collections.singletonMap("Dark", new Theme());
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenReturn(mockedThemeList);
        when(mockedThemeList.getThemesAsMap()).thenReturn(expectedThemes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Failed to mock dependencies properly.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertFalse(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes should not be empty.");
    assertEquals(expectedThemes, actualThemes, "The themes loaded do not match the expected themes.");
}

The test failure in the `handleIOExceptionWhenLoadingThemes` method is primarily due to the test's inability to correctly mock the behavior of the `loadThemes` method in the `ThemeLoader` class. The `loadThemes` method is designed to catch any `IOException` and return an empty map when such an exception occurs. However, the test setup with Mockito does not effectively simulate this behavior within the actual `loadThemes` method.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Mock Setup**: The test attempts to mock the `ObjectMapper`'s `readValue` method to throw an `IOException`. This part of the setup is correct and should ideally lead the `loadThemes` method to return an empty map.

2. **Static Method Invocation**: The `loadThemes` method is a static method. Mockito, in the standard setup used in the test, cannot mock static methods directly. The mocking of `ObjectMapper` in the test does not affect the `ObjectMapper` instance created and used in the `loadThemes` method. This means that the actual `ObjectMapper` used in `loadThemes` is not mocked and does not throw an `IOException` as expected by the test setup.

3. **Resulting Behavior**: Since the `ObjectMapper` in `loadThemes` is not the mocked instance and does not throw an `IOException`, the method does not return an empty map but proceeds to attempt to read the themes, potentially returning a non-empty map or leading to other unintended behaviors. This results in the assertion failure where the test expects an empty map (`assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty())`), but finds that the map is not empty.

4. **Correcting the Test**: To correctly test the behavior when an `IOException` occurs, you would need to use a mechanism to mock the static method or the behavior of the file reading process in the `loadThemes` method. This could involve using a testing framework that supports static method mocking (like PowerMock) or refactoring the code to be more testable by injecting dependencies or using a factory pattern to obtain the `ObjectMapper`.

In summary, the test fails because the mocking does not influence the actual execution within the `loadThemes` method due to the method's static nature and direct instantiation of `ObjectMapper`, leading to an unmocked, normal execution that does not align with the test's expectations.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void handleIOExceptionWhenLoadingThemes() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenThrow(new IOException("Failed to read file."));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Mocking failed.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes map should be empty on IOException.");
}

/*
The failure of the test function `handleEmptyOrCorruptYAMLFile` in the unit test is due to an issue with the way the business logic in `ThemeLoader.loadThemes()` handles a null or empty result from the mocked `ObjectMapper`. The test is designed to simulate a scenario where reading from a corrupt or empty YAML file results in a `null` return value from `mockedMapper.readValue()` method. The expectation is that the `loadThemes()` method should return an empty map in such cases.

However, the `loadThemes()` method in the business logic does not explicitly check if the result from `readValue()` is `null`. Instead, it directly tries to convert whatever result it gets into a map using the `getThemesAsMap()` method. Since the mocked `readValue()` method is set up to return `null`, this results in the `loadThemes()` method not returning an empty map as expected, but rather continuing without handling the null case properly.

This discrepancy between the expected behavior (returning an empty map) and the actual behavior (not handling the null result properly) leads to the test failing. The test assertion checks if the map is empty, expecting an empty map, but the actual result is not an empty map due to the unhandled null, causing the test to fail with the assertion error.

To fix this issue, the `loadThemes()` method should include a null check on the result of the `readValue()` method, and return an empty map if the result is `null`. This would align the actual behavior with the expected behavior, allowing the test to pass.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void handleEmptyOrCorruptYAMLFile() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenReturn(null);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Failed to mock dependencies properly.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes map should be empty if YAML file is corrupt or empty.");

The test failure in the `loadThemesWithNoThemesInFile` test method is due to the fact that the actual implementation of the `loadThemes()` method in the `ThemeLoader` class is not being used in a way that is compatible with the mocked environment set up in the test.

Here's the breakdown of the issue:

1. **Mock Setup**:
   - The test method mocks the `ObjectMapper` and `ThemeList` classes to simulate the scenario where no themes are loaded from the file. It correctly sets up the mocked `ObjectMapper` to return an empty map when `getThemesAsMap()` is called on the mocked `ThemeList`.

2. **Actual Method Implementation**:
   - The `loadThemes()` method in the `ThemeLoader` class is designed to read from a YAML file using an `ObjectMapper` instance and convert the data into a `ThemeList` object, which is then transformed into a map. If an `IOException` occurs, it returns an empty map.

3. **Test Execution**:
   - The test calls `ThemeLoader.loadThemes()`, which uses its own `ObjectMapper` to read the themes from the file. Since this operation is not mocked or intercepted in the test setup, it operates independently of the mocking logic provided in the test. This means the method attempts to read the actual file and process it.

4. **Assertion Failure**:
   - The assertion in the test expects the result of `ThemeLoader.loadThemes()` to be an empty map. However, since the test does not actually intercept the file reading and object mapping operation within `loadThemes()`, the method does not necessarily return an empty map as expected. Depending on the contents of the `application.yaml` file or the behavior of the file reading when the file is missing or inaccessible, the method's output might not match the expectation set in the test, leading to a failure.

To resolve this issue, the test needs to be adjusted to intercept or mock the static method call to `loadThemes()` itself, or the design of the `loadThemes()` method needs to be changed to allow injecting dependencies such as the `ObjectMapper`, making it more testable by allowing the test to control its behavior more effectively. Alternatively, integration testing approaches could be used where the file system interactions are part of the test.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void loadThemesWithNoThemesInFile() {
    // Arrange
    ObjectMapper mockedMapper = Mockito.mock(ObjectMapper.class);
    ThemeList mockedThemeList = Mockito.mock(ThemeList.class);
    try {
        when(mockedMapper.readValue(any(File.class), eq(ThemeList.class))).thenReturn(mockedThemeList);
        when(mockedThemeList.getThemesAsMap()).thenReturn(Collections.emptyMap());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        fail("Failed to mock dependencies properly.");
    }
    // Act
    Map<String, Theme> actualThemes = ThemeLoader.loadThemes();
    // Assert
    assertTrue(actualThemes.isEmpty(), "Themes map should be empty if no themes are present in the file.");
