1. Scenario: Validate that the function is able to load themes successfully when a valid "application.yaml" file is present in the specified path.
   - Given the "application.yaml" file is present in the "src/main/resources/" directory.
   - When the function "loadThemes()" is called.
   - Then the function should return a Map with the themes present in the "application.yaml" file.

2. Scenario: Validate that the function returns an empty map when the "application.yaml" file is not present in the specified path.
   - Given the "application.yaml" file is not present in the "src/main/resources/" directory.
   - When the function "loadThemes()" is called.
   - Then the function should return an empty map.

3. Scenario: Validate that the function is able to handle an "application.yaml" file with no themes.
   - Given the "application.yaml" file is present in the "src/main/resources/" directory and it does not contain any themes.
   - When the function "loadThemes()" is called.
   - Then the function should return an empty map.

4. Scenario: Validate that the function is able to handle an "application.yaml" file with multiple themes.
   - Given the "application.yaml" file is present in the "src/main/resources/" directory and it contains multiple themes.
   - When the function "loadThemes()" is called.
   - Then the function should return a Map with all the themes present in the "application.yaml" file.

5. Scenario: Validate that the function is able to handle an "application.yaml" file with incorrectly formatted themes.
   - Given the "application.yaml" file is present in the "src/main/resources/" directory and it contains themes that are not formatted correctly.
   - When the function "loadThemes()" is called.
   - Then the function should return an empty map.

6. Scenario: Validate that the function is able to handle an "application.yaml" file that is not formatted correctly.
   - Given the "application.yaml" file is present in the "src/main/resources/" directory and it is not formatted correctly.
   - When the function "loadThemes()" is called.
   - Then the function should return an empty map.
