Based on the provided scenario, I'll create a CSV file that represents the API call to retrieve daily time series data for AAPL stock from Alphavantage.co. Since no specific API specs were provided, I'll use a typical structure for Alphavantage API calls.

Here's the CSV file content:

METHOD^|^URL^|^REQ_HEADERS^|^REQ_BODY^|^RESPONSE_CODE^|^RESPONSE_BODY
GET^|^https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=AAPL&apikey=demo^|^{'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}^|^^|^200^|^{'Meta Data': {'1. Information': 'Daily Prices (open, high, low, close) and Volumes', '2. Symbol': 'AAPL', '3. Last Refreshed': '2024-07-09', '4. Output Size': 'Compact', '5. Time Zone': 'US/Eastern'}, 'Time Series (Daily)': {'2024-07-09': {'1. open': '227.9300', '2. high': '229.4000', '3. low': '226.3721', '4. close': '228.6800', '5. volume': '48169822'}, '2024-07-08': {'1. open': '226.1000', '2. high': '228.2200', '3. low': '225.6800', '4. close': '227.8500', '5. volume': '46528000'}}}

Note:
1. The METHOD is GET as we're retrieving data.
2. The URL includes query parameters for the TIME_SERIES_DAILY function, AAPL symbol, and a demo API key.
3. A basic User-Agent header is included in REQ_HEADERS.
4. The REQ_BODY is empty as this is a GET request.
5. A successful response code of 200 is assumed.
6. The RESPONSE_BODY includes the meta data and time series data, with the specific date (2024-07-09) mentioned in the scenario, along with an additional date for context.
