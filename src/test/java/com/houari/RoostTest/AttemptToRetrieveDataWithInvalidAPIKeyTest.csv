Based on the provided scenario, I'll generate a CSV file with the appropriate headers and data for the API call. Here's the populated data file:

METHOD^|^URL^|^REQ_HEADERS^|^REQ_BODY^|^RESPONSE_CODE^|^RESPONSE_BODY
GET^|^https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED&symbol=IBM&apikey=invalid_key^|^{'Accept': 'application/json'}^|^^|^401^|^{'error': 'Invalid API key. Please retry or visit https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key for assistance.'}

Notes on the populated data:

1. METHOD: GET, as specified in the scenario.
2. URL: The base URL is combined with the query parameters as provided in the scenario.
3. REQ_HEADERS: Added a basic 'Accept' header for JSON responses, which is common for API requests.
4. REQ_BODY: Left empty (^) as GET requests typically don't have a request body.
5. RESPONSE_CODE: Used 401 (Unauthorized) to indicate an authentication error.
6. RESPONSE_BODY: Created a sample error response indicating an invalid API key, which aligns with the scenario's expectation of an authentication error.

This CSV structure follows the provided instructions and represents the API call described in the scenario.
