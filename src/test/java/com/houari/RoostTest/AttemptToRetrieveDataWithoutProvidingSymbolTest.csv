Based on the provided scenario, I'll generate a CSV file with the appropriate headers and data for the API call described. Here's the CSV content:

METHOD^|^URL^|^REQ_HEADERS^|^REQ_BODY^|^RESPONSE_CODE^|^RESPONSE_BODY
GET^|^https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED&apikey=demo^|^{}^|^^|^400^|^{'Error Message': 'Invalid API call. Please retry or visit the documentation (https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) for TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED.'}

Notes on the generated CSV:

1. METHOD: GET, as specified in the scenario.
2. URL: The base URL is combined with the query parameters mentioned in the scenario.
3. REQ_HEADERS: An empty object is used as no specific headers are mentioned.
4. REQ_BODY: Left empty as GET requests typically don't have a request body.
5. RESPONSE_CODE: 400 is used to indicate an error, as the scenario expects an error response.
6. RESPONSE_BODY: A sample error message is provided, indicating that the API call is invalid due to missing required parameters (in this case, the 'symbol' parameter).

This CSV represents the API call described in the scenario, where a request is made without providing a symbol, which should result in an error response.
