Based on the provided scenario, I'll generate the CSV data file for API testing. Here's the populated data file:

METHOD^|^URL^|^REQ_HEADERS^|^REQ_BODY^|^RESPONSE_CODE^|^RESPONSE_BODY
GET^|^https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=AAPL&apikey=demo^|^{}^|^^|^200^|^{'Meta Data': {'1. Information': 'Daily Prices (open, high, low, close) and Volumes', '2. Symbol': 'AAPL', '4. Output Size': 'Compact', '5. Time Zone': 'US/Eastern'}, 'Time Series (Daily)': {'2023-05-26': {'1. open': '173.32', '2. high': '175.77', '3. low': '173.11', '4. close': '175.43', '5. volume': '53571816'}, '2023-05-25': {'1. open': '172.41', '2. high': '173.90', '3. low': '171.69', '4. close': '172.99', '5. volume': '56058312'}}}

Note: 
1. The URL includes the query parameters as specified in the scenario.
2. The request headers and body are empty as this is a GET request without any specified headers or body.
3. The response code is set to 200 as specified in the scenario.
4. The response body includes the 'Meta Data' with the specified fields and values, and a sample 'Time Series (Daily)' data for two days. In a real response, there would be more days of data, but I've included just two for brevity.
5. The time series data includes all the fields specified in the scenario for each day.
6. The actual values in the time series are fictional and would vary in a real response.
