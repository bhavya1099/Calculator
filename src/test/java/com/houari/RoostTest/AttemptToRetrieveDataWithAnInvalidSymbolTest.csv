Based on the provided scenario, I'll generate a CSV file with the appropriate headers and data for the API call described. Here's the CSV content:

METHOD^|^URL^|^REQ_HEADERS^|^REQ_BODY^|^RESPONSE_CODE^|^RESPONSE_BODY
GET^|^https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=INVALID_SYMBOL&apikey=demo^|^{'Accept': 'application/json'}^|^^|^200^|^{'Error Message': 'Invalid API call. Please retry or visit the documentation (https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) for TIME_SERIES_DAILY.'}

Notes on the generated CSV:

1. METHOD: GET, as specified in the scenario.
2. URL: The base URL is combined with the query parameters as described in the scenario.
3. REQ_HEADERS: A basic 'Accept' header is included, assuming JSON response is expected.
4. REQ_BODY: Left empty as GET requests typically don't have a request body.
5. RESPONSE_CODE: Assumed to be 200 as the API might return a successful response with an error message in the body.
6. RESPONSE_BODY: An error message indicating an invalid API call, which aligns with the scenario's expectation of an error for an invalid symbol.

This CSV represents a single API call as described in the given scenario, formatted according to the provided instructions.
