The YAML configuration file has been audited and corrected to comply with Artillery's requirements. The changes made include separating each action within scenario flows into individual objects, ensuring each object has only one key. Additionally, the indentation, list formatting, and key-value compliance have been validated and corrected. The preprocessing scripts, if any, have been removed.
