I understand your task. However, after carefully analyzing the given Gherkin scenario and comparing it with the provided API specification, I've noticed that the scenario doesn't match the available API endpoints. The Gherkin scenario describes a DELETE operation for a product API, but the API spec only includes a GET endpoint for querying financial data.

Given this mismatch, I cannot generate an accurate Artillery test script based on the provided Gherkin scenario. The API specification doesn't include any endpoints or methods related to product management or deletion.

If you'd like me to generate an Artillery test script for the actual API provided (the Alpha Vantage API for financial data), I'd be happy to do so. Alternatively, if you have an updated API specification that matches the product management scenario, please provide it, and I'll create the appropriate Artillery test script.
